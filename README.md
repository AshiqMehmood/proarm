The proposed model of the Transradial (below elbow) prosthetic arm will be designed for a Right Lower arm amputee. 
The arm will be partially controlled by EMG signals using surface electrodes. 
The processing unit in the prosthetic arm consists of EMG acquisition system amplifier, filtering system, controller which continuously take feedback and work accordingly as per the user’s requirement.
 Controller unit along with encoders mounted on motors which are present in closed loop system gives a real time interface between the arm and the user. The arm structure is such that it includes five fingers individually controlled by independent actuators. 
Actuators comprises of a servomotor and its encoder unit. The proposed structure also includes tendon force sensors which can give touch sense through peripheral nerve interfaces. Prosthetic arm is powered by a Lithium-Polymer (Lipo) battery.
